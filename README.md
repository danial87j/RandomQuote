# Project Description 

Welcome to Random Quote – a tiny corner of the internet where words have power! 
No clicks, no clutter — just open the page and boom, a fresh quote is served straight to your screen. Whether it’s wise, witty, or wonderfully weird, you never know what you're gonna get — and that’s the fun of it!

This minimalist site fetches a random quote from a public API the moment you visit. It’s fast, clean, and always ready to drop some knowledge or give you a little boost.

Made with modern web tech and a lot of good vibes. Enjoy the randomness!
